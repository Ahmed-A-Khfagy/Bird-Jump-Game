# Bird-Jump-Game
This game was developed in CS50 introduction to game development course, but I have modified on it since then,
this game wasn't that interesting for me so I haven't cared so much about the file manegment since I had finsished it, but I learned about it after I had finsihed this project and applied it in the first project in the course which is pong, which is also on github.

This project was made using LOVE2D 11.2
